# zuleyha
a simple web application to watch how's it going with computers that are registered
(why not SNMP? well, i made this for fun.)

It requres python3, jinja2.

To run, first you should register some slave machines. 


e.g.:
```
python zuleyha.py -r localhost ugurkoltuk
```

to run,


```
python zuleyha.py
```

It is unknown whether I'll continue working on this or not.
